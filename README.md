# Project Description

I've wanted to build a native Windows application for a while and have explored multiple frameworks in the process. This project is the result of my experimentation with the Tauri framework: https://v2.tauri.app/.
To keep it simple, I created an application for searching, listening to, and downloading podcasts using RSS feeds.

## Project Architecture
Frontend was created using Svelte framework while the backends for the project is written in Rust.\
https://svelte.dev/

## Installing Project

Clone this Git Repository and then navigate to the main folder and then run 'npm install' from the commandline. Next run 'npm run tauri dev' from the commandline to start the application.
